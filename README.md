# My First Remote Repo

This is my first remote repo.

It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!


I'm 25 years old and have just started week 1 of Academy Tech. I live in London and am American. I love to figure skate! 


I'm excited to learn how to code!
